The post is part of Section 2 (ELT with Apache Spark) of the exam outline and covers these topics of the Databricks Exam Guide:

● Extract data from a single file and from a directory of files.  
● Identify the prefix included after the FROM keyword as the data type.   
● Create a view, a temporary view, and a CTE as a reference to a file.  
● Identify that tables from external sources are not Delta Lake tables.   
● Create a table from a JDBC connection and from an external CSV file.  

So, let's crush this exam!
