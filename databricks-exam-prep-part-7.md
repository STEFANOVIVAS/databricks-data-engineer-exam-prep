Databricks uses Delta Lake as the optimized storage layer for tables in its lakehouse and one of the main evolutions of the data lakehouse over the data lake is the implementation of ACID transactions,  which was normally found in relational databases/data Warehouses.

In Part 7 of our Databricks Data Engineer exam prep series, we talk more about what ACID transactions are and their benefits in Delta Lake.

The post is part of Section 3 (Incremental Data Processing) of the exam outline and covers these topics of the Databricks Exam Guide:

● Identify where Delta Lake provides ACID transactions.   
● Identify the benefits of ACID transactions.   
● Identify whether a transaction is ACID-compliant.   
● Compare and contrast data and metadata.   
● Compare and contrast managed and external tables.   
● Identify a scenario to use an external table.   
● Create a managed table.   
● Identify the location of a table.  

So, let's crush this exam!
